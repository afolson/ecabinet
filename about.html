    <img src="leaf.png" width="125" height="125" alt="" />
    <p>My name is Amanda. I'm not sure what else to say about that.</p>
    <p>I currently work for Linode as a marketing...person? I think calling marketers "people" is being pretty generous to us. I'd sell you my soul for 4 easy payments of $19.95.</p>
    <p>I also worked as a writer/editor for the <a href="http://library.linode.com">Linode Library</a>, which is a pretty awesome collection of documents and how-to articles for Linode customers and general Linux users.</p>
    <p>In my "spare time" (because really, who actually has that?) I like to read and write. I'm currently writing a book that I hope to have published next year, but I'm not holding my breath. I also dabble in code and do some consulting work. Most people would tell you about their hobbies here -- I guess I'm trying to say that burning the candle at both ends is one of mine.</p>
